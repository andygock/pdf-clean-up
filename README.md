# PDF Clean Up

Removes JavaScript print commands from a PDF file.

PDF files generated by Reckon Hosted contain the following compressed JavaScript object which attempts to automatically force the PDF client to open a print dialog.

```js
this.print({bUI: false, bSilent: true, bShrinkToFit: true});
```

This is a drag and drop web app which attempts to remove this behaviour, by removing this JavaScript code.
